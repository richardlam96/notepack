### Features to implement
1. Have a way to easily get ticket names for adding new testflows
1. Edit mode, using vim sessions
  * should open the description.md and the newest testflow_mk.md
  * this may require changing the Global paths to use the ticket/ directory as
    well
  * making that change would also make getting the ticket names easier
2. Mode and possibly new config for adding to features/
3. Possibly more global variables for the current testflow
4. A dashboard showing statuses of tickets and features
