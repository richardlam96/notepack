### Features to implement
1. Have a way to easily get ticket names for adding new testflows
1. Edit mode, using vim sessions
  * should open the description.md and the newest testflow_mk.md
  * this may require changing the Global paths to use the ticket/ directory as
    well
  * making that change would also make getting the ticket names easier
2. Mode and possibly new config for adding to features/
  * Figure out the structure of a "feature" (directories and files)
  * Should just be like a list of tickets
  * Make creating a new ticket more abstract for above bullet
  * Temp solution now is ticket naming ("grouping") conventions
3. Possibly more global variables for the current testflow
4. A dashboard showing statuses of tickets and features
